200 Number of Islands
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3


Constraints:
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

Solution:
1. BFS with mutation of grid matrix

Time: O(V+E), Space: O(V+E)

2. BFS without mutation of grid matrix (use boolean visited matrix)

Time: O(V+E), Space: O(V+E)

3. DFS with mutation of grid matrix
